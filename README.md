One day, this will be a complete library written in ES 5 (or above) that will have a parser parsing itself so it runs on ES 3 and probably back to IE 6.
At the moment, it is just a bunch of scripts put together but you might find some interest in those:
- [A parser using PEG](https://github.com/XJSLib/XJSParser)
- [A way to manipulate mathematical items such as rational numbers and matrix](https://github.com/XJSLib/XJSMathematics)
